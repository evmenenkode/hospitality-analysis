# Hospitality Analysis PowerBI Dashboard
## Overview
This repository contains a PowerBI dashboard designed for hospitality analysis, focusing on hotels across India. The dashboard employs a star schema data model with five tables: dim_date, dim_rooms, dim_hotels, fact_booking, and fact_aggregated_booking. The key performance indicators (KPIs) included in the dashboard provide valuable insights into hotel performance metrics.

## Data Model
The data model used for this analysis follows a star schema, facilitating efficient querying and reporting. The tables in the model are:

- dim_date: Contains date-related attributes.
- dim_rooms: Contains information about the rooms in the hotels.
- dim_hotels: Contains information about the hotels.
- fact_booking: Contains detailed booking records.
- fact_aggregated_booking: Contains aggregated booking data.
## Key Measures and KPIs
The dashboard includes several calculated measures to present the main KPIs, which are crucial for understanding the performance of the hotels. These measures include:

- RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): Measures the revenue generated per available room.
- DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): Indicates the number of rooms available for sale each day.
- ADR (Average Daily Rate): Represents the average rate charged per occupied room.
- DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights): Shows the number of rooms booked each day.
- DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights): Reflects the number of rooms utilized each day.
## Dashboard Features
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the hotel performance through various visualizations and filters. Stakeholders can interact with the dashboard to drill down into specific metrics, time periods, and dimensions to gain deeper insights.

## Visualizations
## 1. KPI Cards
At the top of the dashboard, six cards display the main KPI numbers, each with week-over-week changes. These KPIs provide an at-a-glance summary of hotel performance metrics:

- Revenue: Shows the total revenue generated.
- DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): Displays the number of rooms available for sale each day.
- RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): Indicates the revenue generated per available room.
- Occupancy %: Reflects the percentage of rooms occupied.
- ADR (Average Daily Rate): Represents the average rate charged per occupied room.
- Realisation %: Measures the percentage of revenue realized against the potential revenue.
Each card includes an arrow indicator and a percentage to show the change compared to the previous week, helping stakeholders quickly understand performance trends.

## 2. KPI Table by Day Type
Under the KPI cards, a table presents four key KPIs (RevPAR, Occupancy %, ADR, and Realisation %) grouped by day type (weekend or weekday). This table allows stakeholders to compare hotel performance metrics between weekends and weekdays, providing insights into how different days of the week impact the business.

- RevPAR: Revenue per available room for weekdays and weekends.
- Occupancy %: The occupancy rate for weekdays and weekends.
- ADR: Average daily rate for weekdays and weekends.
- Realisation %: Realization percentage for weekdays and weekends.
This table helps identify patterns and trends related to day-specific performance, aiding in targeted decision-making and strategic planning.

## 3. Revenue by Category Pie Chart
The pie chart provides a visual representation of the revenue distribution between different categories of hotels. This chart helps stakeholders quickly understand the contribution of each hotel category to the overall revenue.

Categories:
- Business Hotel: Represents the portion of revenue generated by business hotels.
- Luxury Hotel: Represents the portion of revenue generated by luxury hotels.
By displaying the revenue distribution, this chart allows stakeholders to assess the performance of different types of hotels and make informed decisions about resource allocation and marketing strategies for each category.

## 4. Weekly Trend Line Chart
The line chart tracks the performance of three key KPIs over time, with week numbers on the X-axis and the KPI values on the Y-axis. This chart provides a visual representation of trends and patterns across different weeks.

- X-Axis: Week Number
- Y-Axis: KPI Values
Lines:

- RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): The blue line represents the weekly trend of revenue generated per available room.
- ADR (Average Daily Rate): The green line shows the average rate charged per occupied room, tracked weekly.
- Occupancy %: The orange line indicates the percentage of rooms occupied each week.
This chart helps stakeholders to:

- Identify seasonal trends and fluctuations.
- Compare the performance of different KPIs over time.
- Analyze how changes in one KPI might correlate with changes in others.
By monitoring these key metrics weekly, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to optimize hotel operations and improve overall performance.

## 5. Combined Line and Bar Chart
This chart combines a line chart and a bar chart to provide a comprehensive view of the performance across different booking platforms. The X-axis lists the booking platforms, while the Y-axis displays the values for ADR and Realisation %.

- X-Axis: Booking Platforms
- Y-Axis: KPI Values
Line:

- ADR (Average Daily Rate): The line represents the average daily rate for bookings made through each platform, showing how the pricing strategy varies across different channels.
Bars:

- Realisation %: The bars represent the realization percentage for each booking platform, indicating the proportion of potential revenue that is actually realized.
This combined chart helps stakeholders to:

- Compare the effectiveness of different booking platforms.
- Analyze how ADR varies by platform and its impact on overall revenue.
- Assess the efficiency of revenue realization across various channels.
By visualizing these KPIs together, stakeholders can identify the most and least effective booking platforms, allowing for strategic adjustments to marketing and pricing strategies.
